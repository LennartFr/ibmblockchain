# Hyperledger Basic Components

## [Hyperledger Fabric CA](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#hyperledger-fabric-ca)
Hyperledger Fabric provides an optional certificate authority service that you may choose to use to generate the certificates and key material to configure and manage identity in your blockchain network. However, any CA that can generate [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) certificates may be used.

## Peers The connections from peers are over GRPC rather than HTTPS.
